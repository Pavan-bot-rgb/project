# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions Tracker by Sector

This project is a data analysis and visualization initiative focused on tracking CO₂ emissions across countries and sectors (transport, electricity, buildings, etc.). It leverages historical data to offer actionable insights for environmental policy and awareness.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze global CO₂ emissions from 1990 onwards  
- Break down emissions by country and economic sector  
- Visualize patterns and trends to identify top contributors  
- Present KPIs and interactive visuals using Tableau
